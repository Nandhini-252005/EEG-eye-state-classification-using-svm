# EEG eye state Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVC)

This project focuses on **EEG (Electroencephalogram) eye state classification** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier. The model is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and is intended for educational and research-oriented learning purposes.

##  Project Overview

EEG signals are electrical signals generated by the brain and are widely used in neurological studies, brain–computer interfaces (BCI), and medical diagnosis.

In this project:
- EEG signal features are used as input
- Data is preprocessed and scaled
- A **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** is trained to classify EEG signals into different classes
- Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics

## Algorithm Used

### Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- Supervised learning algorithm
- Finds an optimal hyperplane with maximum margin
- Effective for high-dimensional data like EEG features
- Supports different kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial)

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if used)
